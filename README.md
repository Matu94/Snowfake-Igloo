## 📖 Overview

**Igloo** is a low-code GUI that simplifies Snowflake database object management. Instead of writing DDL from scratch, you can visually design and deploy Tables, Views, and Dynamic Tables through an intuitive wizard-style interface. It's perfect for data engineers, analysts, and anyone who wants to work with Snowflake objects without constantly context-switching to SQL editors.


## Why Igloo?

- Visual First: Point-and-click interface for object creation
- Smart Metadata: Auto-fetches schemas, tables, and column definitions
- Preview & Deploy: Review generated DDL before execution
- All-in-Snowflake: Runs as a Snowflake Streamlit app (no external hosting needed)
- Extensible Design: Built with a clean component architecture for easy customization


## Features

### Connection Dashboard
- Real-time **connection status** monitoring.
- Visual display of current **Role**, **Warehouse**, and **Database**.
- Secure credential management via Streamlit secrets.

### Object Builder
A Wizard-style interface to create objects from scratch or based on existing data:
- **Tables:** Define columns, types, and nullability manually.
- **Views:** Select source schemas/tables and apply simple column mappings.
- **Dynamic Tables:** Configure target lag and warehouse settings visually.

### Low-Code Data Editor
- **Interactive Grid:** Add, remove, and modify columns using a spreadsheet-like interface.
- **Smart Type Detection:** Automatically fetches and suggests data types from source tables.

### One-Click Deployment
- Generates production-ready DDL.
- **Preview Mode:** Review the SQL code before deploying.
- **Direct Execution:** Deploys the object to Snowflake with a single click.

```

## Configure Secrets
Create a file named `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in the root directory and add your Snowflake credentials:

```toml
[snowflake]
user = "YOUR_USER"
password = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
account = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER"
role = "YOUR_ROLE"
warehouse = "YOUR_WAREHOUSE"
database = "YOUR_DATABASE"
schema = "YOUR_SCHEMA"
```


## Future Roadmap

- [X] **Column Transformations:** The option to implement column level transformation (e.g., `LEFT()`).
- [X] **Join objects:** The opportunity to use join with other objects.
- [X] **Modify Existing Objects:** Load an existing table/view and apply changes.
- [X] **GIT integration:** Implement a version control system.
